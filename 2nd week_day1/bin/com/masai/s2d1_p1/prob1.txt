Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?
====================================================================================

Static Variables: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at a class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.

Non-Static Variable
Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable.
These variable are created when the block in entered or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.
The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these variable only within that block.
Initialisation of Local Variable is Mandatory.
