Q1) a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.
============================================================================================
Since String is a class in java along with primitive data type. thats why it is immutable.
difference b/w string and string builder:-
------------------------------------------
1. string is syncronised while string builder is non-syncronised.
2. string is less efficient while string builder is more efficient than string.
3. string builder was introduced later in java.

methods 0f string class:-
-------------------------
1. toString()//which converts into string
2. toUpperCase()
3. toLowerCase()
4. trim()
5. startWith()
6. concate()



Q1) b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? 
===========================================================================================
equals method compare the value only, while == compare the value along with address.


And what will be the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.
Code snippet 1 >
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ans. true because it will consider text only.

Code snippet 2 >
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("abc");
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ans. True beacuse it will also compare text which is same.

Code snippet 3 >
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1==s2);
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ans. False because s1 and s2 are refering to object and address of both the object will be different.
