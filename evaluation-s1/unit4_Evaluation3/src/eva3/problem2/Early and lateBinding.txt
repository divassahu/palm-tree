Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Early binding-
1)the binding which is dicided at compile time by the compiler that which method is to be called, is known as early binding.

2)by early binding, static polymorphism can be achieved.

3)example-method overloading.

	class A{
		void funA(int i){
		syso("inside funA(int) of A");
	}
		void funA(String str){
		Syso("inside funA(String) of A");
	}
}

	Class Main{
		public static void main(String[] args){
		A a1=new A();
		a1.funA("ABC");//inside funA(String) of A
		a1.funA(10);//inside funA(int) of A
	}
}



Late binding-
-------------
1)the binding in which the copmpiler doesen't decide the method which to be called, it is decided at run time.

2)2)by early binding, dynamic polymorphism can be achieved.

3)example- method override. 

	class A{
		void funA(int i){
		syso("inside funA(int) of A");
	}
}

	class B extends A{
	@override
	void funA(int i){
	Syso("inside overriden of funA(int i) of A");
	}
}

	class Main{
		public static void main(String[] args){
		A a1=new B();
		a1.funA(20);// inside overriden of funA(int i) of A
	}
}
