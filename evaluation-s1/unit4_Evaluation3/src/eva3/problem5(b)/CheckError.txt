Question 5:
-----------
a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?

	interface A{
	int i = 111;
	}

	class B implements A{
	void methodB(){
	i = 222;
	}
}

in the above application there is an compilation error.
we can not re-assign value of i ib class B as i is the instance variable of interface A.
