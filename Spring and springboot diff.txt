Spring is an open-source framework for building Java applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.

Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring framework that makes it easier to create stand-alone, production-grade applications. It provides pre-configured defaults for many components, reduces the amount of XML configuration required, and automatically configures necessary components based on the dependencies added to the project.

The advantages of using Spring Boot over Spring are:

Simplified Configuration: Spring Boot provides pre-configured defaults for many components and reduces the amount of XML configuration required.

Auto Configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures necessary components based on the dependencies added to the project, making it easier to get started.

Standalone Applications: Spring Boot creates stand-alone, production-grade applications that you can "just run."

Embeddable Server: Spring Boot includes an embedded Tomcat server, eliminating the need to deploy to an external server.

Actuator: Spring Boot includes built-in endpoints for monitoring and managing the application, making it easier to monitor and maintain.

CLI: Spring Boot includes a command-line interface (CLI) that can be used to quickly develop and test Spring applications.

Testing: Spring Boot provides many tools to facilitate testing and make it easier to write tests for your application.
