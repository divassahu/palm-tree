The main difference between == and equals() is that == compares the object references, while equals() compares the object values.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

==: In Java, == is a comparison operator used to compare the object references. When used with primitive types such as int, double, etc., == compares the actual values of those types. However, when used with objects, == compares the memory addresses of the objects to see if they refer to the same object in memory. In other words, it checks if both variables are pointing to the same instance of the object.

equals(): In Java, equals() is a method that is used to compare the values of two objects to determine whether they are equal. This method is defined in the Object class and can be overridden by classes that need to provide their own implementation. By default, the equals() method compares the memory addresses of the objects, similar to the == operator. However, when the equals() method is overridden, it can be used to compare the internal state of the objects to determine whether they are equal.

Here are some practical applications of these concepts:

Comparing Strings: In Java, String is a class, not a primitive type. When comparing two String objects using ==, Java compares the memory addresses of the objects to see if they refer to the same String instance. However, when comparing two String objects using the equals() method, Java compares the actual contents of the two String objects to see if they are equal.

Comparing Objects: If you have a custom class and you want to compare two instances of that class to see if they are equal, you need to override the equals() method in your class. By default, the equals() method compares the memory addresses of the objects, which is not what you want in most cases.

HashCode: In Java, the hashCode() method is used to return a hash code value for an object. The hash code is used by some data structures such as HashMap and HashSet to quickly identify if two objects are equal or not. In general, if two objects are equal, their hash codes must be equal as well. Therefore, if you override the equals() method, you should also override the hashCode() method to ensure that the hash codes of equal objects are equal.

Some additional notes:

In Java, the == operator is always faster than the equals() method because it only needs to compare the memory addresses of the objects.

When comparing object references, it's important to use == instead of equals() to check for null references. If you try to use equals() on a null reference, you'll get a NullPointerException.

When comparing double or float values, you should always use the Double.compare() or Float.compare() methods instead of == or equals(). This is because double and float values are not exact, and comparing them using == or equals() can lead to unexpected results.
